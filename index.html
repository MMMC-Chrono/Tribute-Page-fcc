      <section>
          <div class="parts">
              <div class="age">age 6</div>
              <div class="list">Rosette and her younger brother, <a href="https://chronocrusade.fandom.com/wiki/Joshua_Christopher" target="_blank">Joshua</a>, were sent to the Seventh Bell Orphanage after their parents' death.</div>
          </div>
          <div class="parts">
              <div class="age">age 7</div>
              <div class="list">She became protective of Joshua who was very sick due to the strain of his Apostle power and immediately disliked Father <a href="https://chronocrusade.fandom.com/wiki/Ewan_Remington" target="_blank">Ewan Remington</a> who came to visit Joshua. So, Rosette always kidnapped Joshua and took him into a nearby woods to avoid Father Remington.
              </div>
          </div>
          <div class="parts">

                Once, while hiding from Father Remington, both slipped and fell into a weak spot in the ground and accidently found pale and weak demon, <a href="https://chronocrusade.fandom.com/wiki/Chrono" target="_blank">Chrono</a> who lost his horns while fighting with his twin brother <a href="https://chronocrusade.fandom.com/wiki/Aion" target="_blank">Aion</a>.

          <div class="parts">
              <div class="age">age 12</div>
              <div class="list">- As Joshua was kidnapped, brainwashed and given Chrono's horn, which made his sickness go away instinctly, by Aion, Rosette made a <a href="https://chronocrusade.fandom.com/wiki/Contract" target="_blank">contract</a> with Chrono to save Joshua, making her life slowly tick away.
              </div>
              <div class="list">- Since then Rosette became an exorcist and joined the special division called "The Order of Magdalene" to stop demons from causing chaos and to find her little brother Joshua.</div>

              </div>
              <div class="list">- The four had their last fight with Aion.
                During that, Stella died while fighting with her older sister brainwashed by Aion.
